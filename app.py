# app.py
"""
This is the main application script. It runs the entire agent workflow.

This script does the following:
1.  Imports the compiled LangGraph app object.
2.  Loads the cafe context from the .md file.
3.  Defines the initial state for the workflow.
4.  Invokes the agent graph to run the full process.
5.  Checks the final state for errors or a final post.
6.  If successful, it calls the notifier to send the post to Discord.
