## AI Marketing Assistant for Small Business

A **multi-agent AI application** designed to act as an autonomous marketing assistant for small businesses, such as local cafes. Built with **LangGraph** and the **OpenAI API**, this system automates the creation of timely, on-brand social media content by analyzing real-time local data.

-----

## Features

  * **Autonomous Opportunity Scouting**: Scans daily **weather forecasts**, **local news** via RSS, and multiple **Google Search** queries for relevant events to identify marketing "hooks."
  * **Strategic Content Generation**: Cross-references opportunities with a user-editable "**Marketing Playbook**" (`cafe_context.md`) to create strategically aligned content.
  * **Multi-Option Briefing**: Produces a **daily marketing brief** with multiple, ready-to-use post ideas: one tailored to the weather and several unique ideas for local events.
  * **Simple Web Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction, allowing the user to edit the marketing playbook, trigger the workflow, and view results.
  * **Automated Discord Notifications**: Sends the final, gracefully formatted brief directly to a **Discord channel** for easy review and approval.
